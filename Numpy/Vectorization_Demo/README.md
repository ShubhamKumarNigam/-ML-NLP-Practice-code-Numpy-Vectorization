# Vectorization in Python
Vectorization is used to speed up the Python code without using loop. Using such a function can help in minimizing the running time of code efficiently.

Here I demonstrate the dot prodct using for loop and using vectorization. Which clearly shows the vectorization will take less time compare to the using loops.
